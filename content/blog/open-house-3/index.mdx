## Interviewing Skills and Job Skills

### Plan Interview Prep Smartly

Start preparing 2–3 months before your switch. This keeps your prep sharp, aligned with current trends, and avoids burnout.

### Secure an Offer Before Leaving

Never resign without a confirmed offer. Staying employed reduces stress and gives you better leverage in salary talks.

### Worst Case

If you must quit, resign with the mindset of being jobless for a while. [You will find a job](https://www.iamyhr.com/blog/you-will-find-a-job/), but it may take time.

### Prioritize New Role Skills

Once you join, focus fully on skills needed for the role. Stop practicing interview questions, they won’t help and will hinder your growth technically.

### Invest in Learning

Your degree may not give the best ROI, but real growth comes from continuous learning. Free resources exist, but only experts can teach the 20% of React (or any tech) that drives 80% of results.

Invest time and money in quality courses, books, platforms, or mentorship. Treat it as career investment, not expense—the returns are easily 10x.

## What else?

### State management in React

Redux is powerful, but is 99% of the times an overkill for modern apps. Most “state” issues are really server state problems–best handled by tools like React Query. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and syncing without the boilerplate of Redux.

## What is an Open House?

An Open House is a free, informal community call where anyone can join, ask questions about frontend or web development, and connect with others. If no questions come up, we dive into topics like JavaScript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit, Supabase, or whatever the group is interested in. It’s about learning together and building real connections beyond just LinkedIn or Twitter.
