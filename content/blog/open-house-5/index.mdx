## Interviews and Job Roles

This was the first open house conducted through [Cal.com](https://cal.com/iamyhr/open-house-frontend-hire) instead of [Topmate](https://topmate.io/iamyhr).

### Discussion One: Giving Interviews While Working In-Office

If you are working in an office setting, how do you plan on giving interviews to other companies?

- Option 1: Try to schedule the interviews for weekends, but most interviewers don’t work on weekends.
- Option 2: Step out of the office for the interview and return afterward. There is often no other practical way to manage it.

### Discussion Two: Dealing with a 3-Month Notice Period

Many companies in India require a minimum notice period of 2–3 months.

- Let the recruiter know that your notice period can be negotiated, and also ask them what the notice period is at their company.
- Never resign or submit your notice without having at least one offer in hand—preferably two.
- In the worst case, have at least three interviews lined up before you put in your notice.

### Discussion Three: Job Roles

Frontend engineers can explore many roles beyond traditional frontend development.

- **Forward Deployed Engineering** is one such role. Read this article by Pragmatic Engineer to learn more: [https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/forward-deployed-engineers](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/forward-deployed-engineers).
- **Product Engineering:** Frontend engineers are often closest to the users from a product perspective. Picking up product skills becomes easier in this role. Learning design fundamentals and understanding the core business can help you excel.

### Book Recommendation: _No Shortcuts_ by Nistha Tripathi

Anyone even slightly interested in startups should read _No Shortcuts: Rare Insights from 15 Successful Startup Founders_ by [Nistha Tripathi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisthatripathi/): [https://www.amazon.in/No-Shortcuts-Insights-Successful-Start-up/dp/9352808266](https://www.amazon.in/No-Shortcuts-Insights-Successful-Start-up/dp/9352808266).

It is exceptionally well-written—one of the most concise and crisp books I’ve ever read.

## What is an Open House?

An Open House is a free, informal community call where anyone can join, ask questions about frontend or web development, and connect with others. If no questions come up, we dive into topics like JavaScript, React, Next.js, SvelteKit, Supabase, or whatever the group is interested in. It’s about learning together and building real connections beyond just LinkedIn or Twitter.
