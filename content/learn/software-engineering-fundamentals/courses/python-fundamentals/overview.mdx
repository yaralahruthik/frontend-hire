## Why Python for Frontend Engineers?

As a frontend engineer, you're already fluent in JavaScript/TypeScript. Python shares many concepts with JavaScript but offers a different syntax and philosophy. This course will help you leverage your existing knowledge to learn Python quickly.

## What You'll Learn

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- Object-oriented programming
- Modules and package management
- Error handling
- Asynchronous programming

## Course Approach

Every Python concept will include a direct JavaScript/TypeScript comparison so you can map your existing knowledge to Python syntax and patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Familiarity with npm/package management

## Time Commitment

This is a self-paced course. Each chapter takes 10-20 minutes to complete.
