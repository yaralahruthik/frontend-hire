As a frontend engineer, you build interfaces. But great engineers build **solutions to problems**. This course teaches you to think like a product builder, not just a code writer.

This isn't about frameworks or libraries. It's about understanding problems, validating solutions, making smart decisions, and shipping products that matter.

## What makes this different?

Most technical resources teach you **how** to build. This course teaches you **what** to build and **why**. You'll learn to:

- Identify real problems worth solving
- Validate ideas before writing code
- Make smart build vs buy decisions
- Ship iteratively and gather feedback
- Measure what actually matters

Perfect for frontend engineers who want to own products, not just implement specs.
