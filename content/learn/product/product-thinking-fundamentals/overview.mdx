description: Product thinking for frontend engineers who want to build solutions, not just features
---

Most frontend courses teach you to build. This one teaches you to **think**.

You'll learn to approach problems like a product builder, make decisions that matter, and ship solutions that users actually need.

## What you'll learn

- **Identify real problems** - Learn to separate symptoms from root causes
- **Validate before building** - Test assumptions without writing production code
- **Make product decisions** - Choose between building, buying, or integrating
- **Ship and learn** - Release iteratively and gather meaningful feedback
- **Measure success** - Track metrics that drive decisions, not vanity

## Who is this for?

Frontend engineers who:
- Want to build their own products
- Are tired of implementing features without context
- Need to make technical decisions that align with business goals
- Want to think beyond "what framework should I use?"

## What this course is NOT

This is not a technical tutorial. You won't learn:
- How to set up a specific framework
- Best practices for a particular library
- Design patterns or architecture deep-dives

You'll learn to think about problems first, solutions second, and implementation third.

## Course structure

We follow a problem-first approach:

1. **What problem are you solving?** - Start with clarity
2. **Validating problems, not solutions** - Test before you build
3. **From problem to solution** - Bridge the gap systematically
4. **Build vs Buy vs Integrate** - Make smart decisions
5. **Choosing constraints** - Use limitations as features
6. **Shipping and learning** - Release strategy that works
7. **Measuring what matters** - Data-driven decisions

Each lesson is short and actionable. No fluff.

Let's start by asking the most important question: **What problem are you solving?**
