title: What Problem Are You Solving?
description: Start with clarity. Most products fail because they solve the wrong problem.
---

Before you write a single line of code, answer this: **What problem are you solving?**

Not "what are you building?" Not "what features will it have?" Just: what problem?

## The problem with skipping this question

Most side projects start with excitement:
- "I want to build a task manager"
- "I'll create a note-taking app"
- "Let me make a portfolio builder"

These aren't problems. They're solutions. And when you start with solutions, you build features nobody needs.

## How to identify real problems

### 1. Look for pain points, not ideas

Ask yourself or others:
- What task takes too long?
- What makes you frustrated?
- What workaround do you use regularly?

**Bad**: "Wouldn't it be cool if..."
**Good**: "I waste 30 minutes every day because..."

### 2. Separate symptoms from root causes

When someone says "I need better time management," that's a symptom.

Dig deeper:
- Why do you feel time-crunched?
- What specific tasks consume your time?
- What happens when you run out of time?

The root cause might be: "I accept too many meetings" or "I context-switch between tools 50 times a day."

### 3. Make it specific

Vague problems lead to vague solutions.

**Vague**: "Developers need better documentation tools"
**Specific**: "Frontend engineers spend 2+ hours writing API integration docs that get outdated within a week"

The specific version tells you exactly what to validate and measure.

## The problem statement framework

Write your problem as:

> **[Who]** struggles with **[what]** because **[why]**, which leads to **[consequence]**.

Examples:

> **Frontend engineers** struggle with **keeping component libraries updated** because **documentation is manual and scattered**, which leads to **inconsistent UI and wasted time debugging**.

> **Solo founders** struggle with **tracking multiple metrics across tools** because **dashboards are expensive and complex**, which leads to **decisions based on incomplete data**.

Notice: no mention of tech stack, frameworks, or implementation. Just the problem.

## Red flags

Watch out for these:
- **"Everyone needs this"** - If it's for everyone, it's for no one
- **"It's like X but better"** - Better how? For whom? Why?
- **"The market is huge"** - Market size doesn't validate a problem
- **Starting with features** - "It will have dark mode, AI, and..." Stop.

## Exercise

Take your current or next project idea. Write:

1. The problem (using the framework above)
2. Three specific pain points this problem causes
3. One person who experiences this problem (be specific)

If you can't answer these clearly, you're not ready to build.

## Why this matters for frontend engineers

You might think: "I just implement what PM gives me."

But when you understand the problem:
- You suggest better solutions
- You push back on bad features
- You build things that actually get used
- You become valuable beyond just coding

Product thinking starts here. With the problem.
