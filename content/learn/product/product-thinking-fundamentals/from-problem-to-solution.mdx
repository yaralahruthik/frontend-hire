title: From Problem to Solution
description: Bridge the gap between problem and implementation systematically
---

You validated the problem. Now what?

Don't jump to code. Design the solution.

## The gap between problem and code

**Problem**: "Frontend engineers waste hours updating component docs"

**Bad next step**: Open VSCode, `npx create-next-app`

**Good next step**: Define what "solving this" actually means

## Solution design framework

### 1. Define success

What does success look like?

**Vague**: "Better documentation"
**Specific**: "Docs update automatically when components change, reducing manual work to under 10 minutes per week"

### 2. List solution approaches

For any problem, there are multiple solutions.

**Example problem**: "Track product metrics across tools"

**Solution approaches:**
1. Build a custom dashboard
2. Use existing tool (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
3. Create a script that exports to spreadsheet
4. Pay for a data warehouse
5. Manually compile a weekly report

Don't commit yet. List options.

### 3. Define constraints

What are your limits?

**Time**: How long can you spend?
**Money**: What's your budget?
**Skills**: What can you actually build?
**Scope**: Solving for 1 person or 1000?

Constraints aren't bad—they force good decisions.

### 4. Choose the simplest solution

The best solution is the one that:
- Solves the problem
- Uses the least resources
- Ships the fastest

**Over-engineered**: Microservices, GraphQL, real-time updates, AI recommendations
**Right-sized**: Static site, manual updates, CSV export

Start simple. Complexity can come later.

## The MVP trap

"MVP" doesn't mean "bad version of full product."

It means: **Minimum version that validates you solved the problem.**

### What to include

Ask: "Without this, does it still solve the problem?"

**Problem**: "Designers need to share prototypes quickly"

**Included**: Upload designs, generate shareable link
**Excluded**: Comments, version history, team management, analytics

Comments are nice. But shareable links solve the problem.

### How to cut scope

Use the **"Not now"** rule:

- Authentication? Not now. (Use magic links)
- Team features? Not now. (Single user)
- Mobile app? Not now. (Web only)
- Dark mode? Not now. (Light mode)

"Not now" isn't "never." It's "later, if needed."

## Solution validation

Before building, validate the solution approach:

### 1. Write the user flow

Step by step, what does the user do?

```
1. User visits site
2. Clicks "Upload"
3. Selects file
4. Gets shareable link
5. Copies link
6. Shares with client
```

If the flow has 15 steps, simplify.

### 2. Sketch the UI (no code)

Use Excalidraw, Figma, or paper.

Does the interface make sense? Can you explain it in 30 seconds?

If you can't sketch it simply, you can't build it simply.

### 3. Get feedback on the approach

Show your sketch to someone with the problem:

"If this existed, would it solve your problem?"

If they ask for 10 more features, your MVP might be off. If they say "yes, exactly," build it.

## The "No Code" test

Can you validate the solution without code?

**Example: Analytics dashboard**
- Manual version: Send weekly email with screenshots
- If they don't use emails, they won't use dashboard

**Example: Chrome extension**
- Manual version: Bookmarklet or copy-paste script
- If nobody uses bookmarklet, extension won't help

Validate usage patterns before building infrastructure.

## When to use existing tools vs build

Ask:
- **Does a solution exist?** → Try it first
- **Is it 80% what you need?** → Use it
- **Is it 40% what you need?** → Maybe customize
- **Is it 0% what you need?** → Build

Building from scratch should be the last option, not the first.

## For frontend engineers: Feature design

When your PM says "Add a notification system":

1. **Problem**: Why do users need notifications?
2. **Success**: What does "working notifications" mean?
3. **Approaches**: Email? In-app? Push? All three?
4. **Constraints**: Time? Team size? Infrastructure?
5. **MVP**: Simplest version that solves the problem

Don't start with "I'll use Socket.io and Redis."

Start with "Do they need real-time, or will daily emails work?"

## The solution document

Before coding, write:

```
Problem: [One sentence]
Success criteria: [What changes when this works?]
Approach: [High-level solution]
MVP scope: [What's included]
Not now: [What's excluded]
User flow: [Step by step]
```

This takes 30 minutes. Saves 30 hours.

## Decision checklist

Before building:

✅ Solution solves the validated problem
✅ MVP scope is clear
✅ You can explain the approach in under 2 minutes
✅ User flow is under 7 steps
✅ Someone with the problem confirmed this would help

If any are missing, you're not ready to code.
