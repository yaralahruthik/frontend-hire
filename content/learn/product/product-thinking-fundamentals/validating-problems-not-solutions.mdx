title: Validating Problems, Not Solutions
description: Test assumptions before writing code. Save weeks of wasted work.

You have a problem. Now prove it's worth solving.

Don't build to find out. Validate first.

## Why validation matters

You can build a perfect product that nobody wants. Perfect code, clean architecture, great UX—all useless if you're solving the wrong problem.

Validation answers:
- Is this problem real?
- Do people care enough?
- Will they change their behavior?

## What to validate

### 1. Problem existence

Does this problem actually exist?

**Don't ask**: "Would you use a tool that..."
**Do ask**: "Tell me about the last time you struggled with X"

If they can't recall a recent, specific instance, the problem isn't painful enough.

### 2. Problem frequency

How often does this happen?

**One-time pain**: Not worth solving
**Weekly pain**: Maybe worth solving
**Daily pain**: Worth solving

### 3. Current solutions

What do people do now?

If they're:
- **Doing nothing**: The pain isn't strong enough
- **Using workarounds**: Good sign—they want it solved
- **Paying for solutions**: Great sign—validated demand

## Validation methods (without coding)

### 1. Problem interviews

Talk to 5-10 people who might have this problem.

**Good questions:**
- "Walk me through how you currently do X"
- "What's frustrating about that process?"
- "What have you tried to fix this?"
- "How much time does this waste?"

**Bad questions:**
- "Would you use my solution?"
- "What features would you want?"
- "Does this sound useful?"

Listen for stories, not opinions.

### 2. Landing page test

Build a simple page explaining the problem and solution. Track:
- Email signups
- Click-through rates
- Time on page

No backend needed. Just:
```html
Problem headline
Brief explanation
Email signup form
```

If you can't get 50 signups from friends/Twitter/Reddit, the problem isn't compelling.

### 3. Manual MVP

Solve the problem manually before automating.

**Example**: Before building a screenshot tool, offer to take screenshots for people yourself. See if they actually use them.

**Example**: Before building a dashboard, send weekly email summaries. If nobody opens them, why build the dashboard?

This validates usage, not interest.

### 4. Content validation

Write about the problem. Post on Twitter, dev.to, Reddit, forums.

If nobody engages, nobody cares.

## How much validation is enough?

**Minimum:**
- 5 problem interviews with clear pain points
- Evidence of current workarounds
- Some signal people would pay (time or money)

**Red flags to stop:**
- People say "that's nice" but can't describe the pain
- No one has looked for solutions
- Positive feedback but no one will share contact info

## Common mistakes

### 1. Asking about solutions

"Would you use a tool that automatically generates API docs?"

They'll say yes to be polite. Ask about the problem instead.

### 2. Talking to the wrong people

Your friends will be supportive. Talk to strangers who have the problem.

### 3. Confusing interest with commitment

**Interest**: "That sounds cool"
**Commitment**: "Can I beta test?" / "Will you tell me when it launches?"

Only commitment validates.

### 4. Skipping validation because "you" have the problem

You're one data point. Even if you have the problem, validate that others do too.

## The validation threshold

Before writing production code, have:

✅ Talked to 5+ people with the problem
✅ Heard specific, recent pain points
✅ Seen evidence of workarounds or paid solutions
✅ Got some commitment (email, follow, beta request)

Without these, you're building on assumptions.

## For frontend engineers

You might think: "Validation isn't my job—that's PM's job."

True for company work. False for:
- Side projects
- Feature proposals
- Technical solutions

When you propose "Let's rebuild this in React Server Components," validate:
- What problem does it solve?
- Who's experiencing this problem?
- What's the cost of not solving it?

Product thinking applies to technical decisions too.
