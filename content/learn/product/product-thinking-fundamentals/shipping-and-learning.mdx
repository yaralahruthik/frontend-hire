title: Shipping and Learning
description: Release strategy that works. Ship fast, learn faster.

Building is easy. Shipping is hard.

Most products stay "almost done" forever. Don't be most products.

## Why shipping matters more than perfection

Perfect code nobody uses < Imperfect code people use

**Shipping gives you:**
- Real user feedback
- Actual usage patterns
- Revenue validation
- Energy to continue

**Perfecting gives you:**
- More assumptions
- More features nobody asked for
- Burnout
- Another unfinished project

## The shipping mindset

### Ship before you're ready

"Ready" is a trap. You're never ready.

**Signs you're delaying unnecessarily:**
- "Just need to add..."
- "Once I fix this edge case..."
- "When the design is perfect..."
- "After I add dark mode..."

These are excuses. Ship now.

### Embarrassment is the goal

If you're not slightly embarrassed by your first version, you waited too long.

**V1 should be:**
- Rough around edges
- Missing obvious features
- Not fully designed
- Barely working

Ship the minimum that solves the problem. Everything else can wait.

## How to ship

### 1. Set a launch date (not "when ready")

**Bad**: "Launch when it's complete"
**Good**: "Launch on Friday, November 15th"

**Make it public:**
- Tweet it
- Tell friends
- Add countdown to site

Public commitment forces shipping.

### 2. Define your MVP (again)

One week before launch, ask:

"What can I cut and still solve the problem?"

**Usually, you can cut:**
- Settings pages
- Profile customization
- Advanced features
- Half the UI polish

Cut it. Ship anyway.

### 3. Plan V1.1 features before V1

Before launching, list:
- What's missing
- What's rough
- What users might ask for

Now ignore this list until after launch.

You think you know what's needed. Users will tell you what's actually needed.

## Where to launch

### 1. Direct outreach (most effective)

Message 10 people who have the problem:

"Hey, I built a thing that solves [problem we discussed]. Want to try it?"

**Why this works:**
- Guaranteed users
- Real feedback
- Warm audience

### 2. Community platforms

Post where your users hang out:

**For dev tools:**
- Twitter/X
- Reddit (r/webdev, r/javascript)
- Hacker News
- Dev.to
- Indie Hackers

**For other tools:**
- Relevant subreddits
- Facebook groups
- Discord servers
- Slack communities

**Rules:**
- Focus on the problem, not features
- Share your learning journey
- Don't spam
- Engage with comments

### 3. Your network

Tweet it. LinkedIn post. Discord. Whatever you use.

Don't underestimate your network. Your first 10 users come from people who know you.

## What to track on launch day

Don't build analytics yet. Use simple tools:

**Must track:**
- Signups/visits (Plausible, Simple Analytics)
- Where they came from (UTM parameters)
- Email signups (plain database table)

**Don't track yet:**
- Feature usage
- Session duration
- Heatmaps
- Detailed funnels

You need volume first. Deep analytics come later.

## Getting feedback

### Good questions

**Ask:**
- "What problem were you trying to solve?"
- "Did this help? Why or why not?"
- "What was confusing?"
- "What's missing that you expected?"

**Don't ask:**
- "What features should I add?"
- "Would you pay for this?"
- "On a scale of 1-10..."

Listen for problems, not feature requests.

### Where to get feedback

1. **Email after first use**: "How was your first experience?"
2. **Reply to launch comments**: Engage deeply
3. **1-on-1 calls**: Offer Zoom calls to early users
4. **Watch them use it**: Screen share, stay silent

Best feedback comes from watching, not asking.

## The first week

### Day 1: Launch

Post everywhere. Reply to every comment. Thank everyone.

### Days 2-3: Fix broken stuff

Something will break. Fix it fast.

Don't add features. Fix issues.

### Days 4-7: Analyze

Look at:
- What people actually use
- Where they drop off
- What they ask about
- What they complain about

**Pattern to watch:**
- 5 people ask for Feature X → Build it
- 1 person asks for Feature Y → Maybe later
- 0 people use Feature Z → Remove it

## Iteration strategy

### The 1-week sprint

After launch:
1. Gather feedback (Week 1)
2. Pick top 3 issues (Weekend)
3. Ship fixes (Week 2)
4. Repeat

Don't plan 6 months ahead. Plan 1 week ahead.

### What to build next

Priority order:

1. **Breaking bugs**: Fix immediately
2. **Confusion**: Clear UX issues
3. **Missing core features**: Asked by 5+ users
4. **Polish**: Only after usage is good

**Never prioritize:**
- Features you think are cool
- Features one person asked for
- Features competitors have
- Features "for enterprise"

Build what users demonstrate they need, not what they say they want.

## When to pivot vs persevere

### Persevere when:
- People use it but want improvements
- Early traction is happening
- Feedback is constructive
- Problem still seems real

### Pivot when:
- Nobody uses it after launch
- Can't explain value in 1 sentence
- You've lost interest
- Problem wasn't real

**Give it 4 weeks minimum** before deciding.

## Building in public

Share your journey:

**Share:**
- What you're building
- Why you're building it
- Problems you're facing
- What you learned
- Metrics (good and bad)

**Don't share:**
- Daily updates (too noisy)
- Every tiny feature (boring)
- Only successes (fake)

Building in public creates accountability, feedback, and early users.

## For frontend engineers

### Your side project launch checklist

✅ MVP solves the core problem
✅ Launch date is set and public
✅ You've messaged 10 potential users
✅ Basic analytics are set up
✅ You have a way to collect feedback
✅ You've planned where to post

If all are checked, launch tomorrow.

### Company features

When shipping features at work:

1. **Beta test**: 10 users before wide release
2. **Feature flags**: Easy rollback
3. **Monitor**: Watch errors and usage
4. **Iterate**: Week-long cycles

Same principles apply.

## The shipping habit

**After this launch:**
- Launch something every month
- Could be small features
- Could be new projects
- Could be big updates

Shipping becomes easier the more you do it.

The hardest launch is the first one. Every one after gets easier.
