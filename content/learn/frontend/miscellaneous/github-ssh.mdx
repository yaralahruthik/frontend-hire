Thanks to [@ksridhar02](https://x.com/ksridhar02) for helping us write this!

<Callout title="AI-powered write-up, verify yourself!" type="warn">
  This is one of those things, most developers (including me) just install and
  use without thinking about it. So, just doing quick-AI write-up to learn it.
</Callout>

The developer's most used tool was Github, so every time you push your changes you will be asked to enter your Github details which is a tiresome work so setting an `ssh key` to your Github will make your life a lot easier.

<Callout title="Official Instructions">
  You should ideally follow the official instructions provided by [GitHub
  here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
</Callout>

## Setup SSH

- Open Your terminal and set the following

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your GitHub username'
git config --global user.email 'your GitHub associated email'
```

- After this step check if you have any SSH keys present locally by this command.

```bash
ls ~/.ssh
```

- Now you have to generate ssh key in your terminal with the following command and click as enter for all the options as default values will be enough for creating a ssh key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
```

- Now you need to copy your SSH public key and add it to GitHub.

### Copying the SSH key

Depending on your operating system, use one of the following methods:

**On Linux (with `xclip`):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**On macOS:**

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This copies the key to your clipboard directly.

**On Windows (using Git Bash or PowerShell):**

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

- Now open your GitHub account in the browser → **Settings** → **SSH and GPG Keys**.
- Click **New SSH Key**, give it a descriptive title (e.g., _My Laptop SSH_), and paste the copied key into the Key field.
- Save it.

- Now open your terminal and Check the ssh key using this command.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

- After this, you will be prompted with this text

```bash
Hi Username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does not support shell access.
```

Though little cryptic but this message means you have successfully setup Github SSH setup.
