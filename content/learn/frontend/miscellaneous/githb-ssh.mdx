<Callout title="AI-powered write-up, verify yourself!" type="warn">
  This is one of those things, most developers (including me) just install and
  use without thinking about it. So, just doing quick-AI write-up to learn it.

The developer's most used tool was Github, so every time you push your changes you will be asked to enter your Github details which is a tiresome work so setting an ssh key to your Github will make your life a lot easier.

## Through the following commands you can easily setup ssh for GitHub in Linux

- Open Your terminal and set the following

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your GitHub username'
git config --global user.email 'your GitHub associated email'
```

- After this step check if you have any SSH keys present locally by this command.

```bash
ls ~/.ssh
```

- Now you have to generate ssh key in your terminal with the following command and click as enter for all the options as default values will be enough for creating a ssh key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_github_email@example.com"
```

- Now you have to copy the ssh and paste it in your github ssh settings, we can copy the ssh key easily using xclip.
- First install XCLIP through the following command

```bash
sudo apt-get install xclip
```

- Now copy your ssh key using xclip by this command

```bash
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

- Now open your GitHub account in the browser go to settings and select SSH and GPG Keys from the left sidebar.
- Now Click New SSH Key button.
- Now enter Your title and enter the copied ssh key from earlier.

```bash
Hi Username! You've successfully authenticated, but Github does not support shell access.
```
