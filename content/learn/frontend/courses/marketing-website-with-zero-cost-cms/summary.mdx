This was a quick introduction to an amazing tool. We found it to be quite a productive tool, hence this short course!

You can honestly let your marketing team control the whole website through that single `.pages.yml` file and some structuring of the codebase to extract out the content into either `.json` or `.md` files.

By the way, deploy your blog, make some changes, and see them reflected within minutes!
