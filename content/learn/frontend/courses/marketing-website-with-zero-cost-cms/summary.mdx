This was a quick introduction to an amazing tool. We found it to be a quite productive tool and hence made this short course!

You can honestly let your marketing team control the whole website through that single `.pages.yml` file and some structuring of the codebase to extract out the content into either `.json` or `.md` files.

By the way, go deploy your blog and try to make changes and see them reflect in a few minutes!
