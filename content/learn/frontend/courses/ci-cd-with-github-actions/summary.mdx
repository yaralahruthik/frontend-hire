description: CI/CD hopefully should be more comfortable now

I hope you understand the point of CI/CD and the problem it solves. If that is clear, then it shouldn't matter where your CI/CD pipeline runs. By the way, you can containerize most of the workflows and run them instead. Iâ€™ll cover this type of workflow when I find some time.

But for now, automate the tasks that belong in a CI/CD pipeline.

See you in the next course! ðŸš€
