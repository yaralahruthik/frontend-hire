description: CI/CD hopefully should be more comfortable now

I hope you understand the point of CI/CD and the problem it solves. If that is clear, then it shouldn't matter where your CI/CD pipeline is. By the way, you can actually containerize most the workflows and run them instead, I would cover this type of workflow when I find some time.

But for now, I want you to automate stuff that belongs in a CI/CD pipeline.

See you in the next course! ðŸš€
