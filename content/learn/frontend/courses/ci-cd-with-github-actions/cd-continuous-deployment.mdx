title: 'Continuous Deployment (CD)'
description: While CI ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and verified, CD takes it further‚Äîautomatically deploying those verified changes to production (or staging) environments.
---

In other words, **CI makes sure your code is always ready to deploy**, and **CD makes sure it actually gets deployed**.

The underlying concepts, setup, and automation tools are largely the same. You‚Äôll still use GitHub Actions (or similar workflow automation) to define pipelines that handle your build, test, and release processes.

For now, we‚Äôll keep this section short since CD closely mirrors CI in structure and philosophy.

I‚Äôll cover the **full CI/CD pipeline setup** in a dedicated **one-off video**, using the [**SuperImpress**](https://github.com/yaralahruthik/super-impress) project‚Äîan open-source product being built publicly as part of the [**Frontend Hire Community**](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx) learning.

I don't have an exact timeline but that session will show how to:

- Automatically deploy code after successful CI checks
- Manage environment-specific deployments (staging, production)
- Roll back safely when things go wrong

## But if you want to try out CD now

<Callout type="info" title="Netlify does the heavy lifting if you just connect the repository!">

Do note that just connecting the repo to Netlify can do the heavy lifting of setting up the continuous deployment. There are certain limitations for private repositories or organization accounts where setting up your own workflow can save you a bit of money.

<Callout type="warn" title="AI Generated Notes">

The steps of the CD given below has been generated by AI. So, things might
break or work unexpectedly! If you get stuck somewhere, you can always reach
out in the [discord community](https://discord.gg/DWAVqksVtx).

Things should ideally work because I use the same workflow file for one of my production sites.

</Callout>

Here‚Äôs a quick way to set up **automatic deployment to Netlify** using **GitHub Actions** for a **React + Vite** project.

### 1. Create a Netlify Site

- Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
- Click **‚ÄúAdd new site ‚Üí Import from Git.‚Äù**
- Connect your **GitHub repository**.
- Set the **build command** to `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`) and **publish directory** to `dist/`.
- Once deployed, copy the **Site ID** and **Personal Access Token** from your Netlify user settings.
  - Go to **User Settings ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens** to generate one.

---

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repo:

- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret**.
- Add the following secrets:

  - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` ‚Üí your Netlify Personal Access Token
  - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` ‚Üí your site‚Äôs unique ID

---

### 3. Add a GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a new workflow file:

```yml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Build and Deploy to Netlify

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      deployments: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 22

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build and export static site
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v2.0
        with:
          publish-dir: './dist'
          production-branch: main
          production-deploy: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          deploy-message: 'Deploy from GitHub Actions'
          enable-pull-request-comment: true
          enable-commit-comment: true
          overwrites-pull-request-comment: true
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
        timeout-minutes: 5
```

### 4. Push to `main`

Whenever you push changes to your `main` branch, GitHub Actions will:

1. Build your Vite project
2. Deploy the build output (`dist/`) to Netlify automatically

You‚Äôll see a new **deployment job** appear under the **Actions** tab in your repo. Once it finishes, your site will be live with the latest version of your code üöÄ
