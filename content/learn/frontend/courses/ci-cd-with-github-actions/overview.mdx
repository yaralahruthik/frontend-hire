If you are a frontend developer, then highly likely that you might be little uncomfortable working with some non-frontend things. One of such things is `CI/CD`.

In fact, I did not touch this stuff (directly at least) for the first two years of my career.

## Introduction

## Course Content

### Starter Repo

We have created a GitHub repository with the initial setup to make it easier for you. You can fork or clone the [repository](https://github.com/yaralahruthik/fh-ci-cd-todo-app) and start working on the project. The branch should be `0-init`.

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yaralahruthik/fh-ci-cd-todo-app.git
```

2. Then run the following commands:

```sh
cd fh-ci-cd-todo-app
pnpm install
```

3. Finally, run the dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

4. Also, publish this to your own GitHub account, otherwise, you won't be able to follow up with the rest of the course.

In the next section, we will setup a CI pipeline with GitHub actions.
